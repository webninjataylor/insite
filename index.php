            <!--<p class="quote">&quot;In modern usage, <strong>civil engineering</strong> is a broad field of engineering that deals with the planning, construction, and maintenance of fixed structures, or public works, as they are related to earth, water, or civilization and their processes. Most civil engineering today deals with power plants, bridges, roads, railways, structures, water supply, irrigation, the natural environment, sewer, flood control, transportation and traffic.  In essence, civil engineering may be regarded as <strong>the profession that makes the world a more agreeable place in which to live</strong>.&quot; ~<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_engineering">Wikipedia</a></p>-->
