                    <strong>Brick Recycling</strong>
                    <img src="images/brick.png" class="photo rp">
                    <p>This 9-acre site was used as a metal recycling facility for many decades.  The current owners decided to seek approval to substantially expand and streamline the facility.  All existing facilities will be demolished, and the new facility will be constructed, including 76,450 square-feet of new building space.  InSite prepared the site plan and managed all permitting aspects of the project.  The local authority required construction of a 15-feet high sound wall along the perimeter of the 9-acre site, which was surrounded on both sides by extensive buffer plantings.  The project also required freshwater wetland and flood hazard area approvals from the NJDEP.</p>

                    <strong>Residential Dock</strong>
                    <img src="images/dipiero.png" class="photo rp">
                    <p>InSite assisted a waterfront homeowner in obtaining approvals from the NJDEP and US Army Corps of Engineers to construct a 300-feet extension to an existing residential dock.  The final approved plans served as the construction document for the project.  The purpose of the dock extension was to reach adequate draft for the family’s boat.</p>

                    <strong>EFCO Corp.</strong>
                    <img src="images/efco.png" class="photo rp">
                    <p>An international industrial company required an expansion of their existing facility to support their rapid growth.  InSite prepared a site plan for a 50,000 square-feet expansion to double the size of their existing warehouse on the 9-acre property.  Since the property is located along a stream, the project required freshwater wetlands and flood hazard area approvals from the NJDEP.  Compliance with NJDEP regulations was extremely complex.</p>

                    <img src="images/mcbw.png" class="photo rp">
                    <p>InSite designed a 128-boat active dry-storage marina on the 2-acre site.  Extensive NJDEP and US Army Corps of Engineers permitting were required.  Due to a change in elevation of 50-feet across the long, narrow site, a series of substantial retaining walls were required to accomplish our client’s development goals.  A new bulkhead along the waterfront with a negative drop boat well was also included in the design of the marina.  Our design included 11 in-water boat staging slips accessed by a series of fixed, floating, and fingers docks, with a fueling station along the edge of the channel.</p>

                    <img src="images/pb.png" class="photo rp">
                    <img src="images/pb.jpg" class="photo rp">
                    <p>InSite designed a site plan for Pep Boys to construct a new facility in southern New Jersey.  The new Service &amp; Tire Center was required to open before the end of the company’s fiscal year, which left a very short timeframe in which to design, obtain approvals, and construct the site.  Working closely with Pep Boys, their professionals, their general contractor, and various municipal officials, the project goals were achieved.</p>

                    <strong>Residential Subdivision</strong>
                    <img src="images/russo.png" class="photo rp">
                    <p>InSite designed a major residential subdivision of the 5.4-acre property.  Following our client’s development goals, we prepared the subdivision design to be variance free in an effort to secure speedy approvals.  Through creative Professional Engineeringdesign techniques, we were able to avoid several jurisdictionalthresholds, including some key elements of stormwater management.  By adhering to sound Professional Planning principles, the subdivision is a perfect complement to its neighborhood.</p>

                    <p>InSite Engineering helped secured Site Plan approvals for a 131 room, three story hotel on state highway for The Briad Group.  Scope included rerouting public sanitary and storm sewer to accommodate lot consolidation, water main extension for subject development and adjacent properties, agency permitting through NJDEP-TWA, NJDEP-BSDW, NJDOT, County and local Soil Conservation District.</p>

                    <img src="images/newmark.png" class="photo rp">
                    <p>The Newmark Schools came to InSite Engineering with ideas to build a state of the art facility so their existing High School and Lower School for special needs children could be brought together and centrally located in Scotch Plains, NJ.  InSite assisted with conceptual development, zone amendment and Site Plan approvals to renovate and expand an existing building to a 60,000 square foot school for special needs children.  Wetlands and floodplain proximity as well as shallow groundwater presented challenges that required innovative stormwater design solutions.  The facility is currently under construction and is set to open its doors for the fall semester of 2013.</p>
