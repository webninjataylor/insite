            <p>Technical proficiency is only part of the picture when a land development project must go through a public meeting process prior to approval.  The same goes for projects that must go through a court of law.  InSiteâ€™s professionals have made hundreds of presentations as experts in the fields of both Professional Engineering and Professional Planning.  Our ability to clearly, concisely, and with conviction present land development applications as well as our enduring and excellent reputation in the field provides our clients the representation needed to properly support every application.  Our presentations are supported by professionally mounted renderings, photo exhibits, and illustrations to further support each application.</p>
