            <h1>Land Surveying</h1>
            <div class="column">
                <p>The basemap of every land development construction document InSite provides is the survey.  Timely and accurate surveys are therefore critical to the success of each project.  There are many solutions for surveying. The type, size, and budget of the project determine the solution.</p>
                <p>Surveying services are also required while projects are ongoing, as well as during construction.  InSite is prepared to assist with the following surveying services:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Boundary and Property Surveys</li>
                    <li>Topographic Surveys</li>
                    <li>Flood Elevation Certificates</li>
                    <li>Construction Stakeouts</li>
