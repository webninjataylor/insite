            <h3>Dunkin’ Donuts – Ewing, NJ</h3>
            <img src="../images/dunkindonuts1.gif" alt="" class="photo-right">
            <p>InSite Engineering has worked with Dunkin’ Donuts franchisees in New Jersey and Pennsylvania to develop new franchise locations, keeping up with the fast track permitting and construction standards of Dunkin’ Brands throughout the process.  In Ewing Township New Jersey, InSite Engineering assisted the franchisee to convert a former gasoline service station site to a Dunkin’ Donuts.  The project involved coordination with the landlord, the former gasoline station owner and their environmental consultants for the removal of underground fuel storage tanks and all fuel pumps and equipment as well as the overhead canopy.  The building was then remodeled inside and out as a Dunkin’ Donuts and new parking, access and circulation were designed and permitted through the municipality and the County Planning Board.</p>
