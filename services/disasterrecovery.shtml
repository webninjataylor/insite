            <h1>Disaster Recovery &amp; Damage Prevention</h1>
            <p>Civil Engineering plays a vital role in every land development project.  It is the professional discipline responsible for the safety, health, and general welfare of the public and the environment.  Occupied structures must be adequately protected from flooding, bridges must be reliable, water and sewer systems are of paramount importance, foundation systems must be reliable…and the list goes on.  InSite gives very careful consideration to safety when preparing our design plans.</p>
            <p><strong>Disaster Recovery:</strong> If you were affected by a disaster, we will work with you to rebuild to current codes and standards.</p>
            <p><strong>Disaster Prevention:</strong> If you are concerned about the potential of a future disaster of your project – especially one previously damaged by a disaster – we will work with you to build to current codes and standards.</p>
            <p>The most recent example of this consideration was Superstorm Sandy, which illustrated the importance of civil engineering.  If you were affected by Superstorm Sandy, we are here to help.  We continue to remain current with codes, regulations, emergency regulations, and industry guidance publications in order to take the guesswork out of rebuilding and new construction in the affected areas.  And when rebuilding, we provide the necessary guidance to reduce the likelihood of future damage from a disaster.</p>
            <p>If you were affected by or have any questions related to Superstorm Sandy, please give us a call.  We are informed and eager to help.  InSite is located at the Jersey Shore; waterfront designs are one of the mainstays of our business.  We have the experience required for site design in shore areas.  We are prepared to assist with the following related services:</p>
