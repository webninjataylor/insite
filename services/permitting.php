            <h1>Permitting &amp; Expediting</h1>
            <p>A key milestone in every land development project is securing all required land use approvals.  At InSite, we focus very intently on this goal since this is when the developer is able to submit for construction permits. Once a project design is complete, we work diligently and closely with every regulatory agency having jurisdiction over the project until each approval is in-hand.  Communication is key; we maintain an ongoing dialogue with our clients and each agency in order to expedite receipt of all approvals.</p>
